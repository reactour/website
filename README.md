# reacTour website

This repo hosts reacTour website. At first, it will only host the event information / link to registeration form, but we're probably going to put the guide here, too.

## Developing

The website uses Gatsby to generate static website from React components. Run
```
gatsby develop
```
in root directory to start developing.


## Deploying

reacTour website is deployed to now.sh via [now CLI](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli). Once installed and configured, use

```
now
```
to deploy.
