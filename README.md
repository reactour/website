# reacTour website

This repo hosts reacTour website. At first, it will only host the event information / link to registeration form, but we're probably going to put the guide here, too.

## Developing

The website uses Gatsby to generate static website from React components. Run
```
gatsby develop
```
in root directory to start developing.
